# Purpose

!!! Tip "Purpose of informative messages"

    "An informative message in the workplace is simply the sharing of meaningful information between people in an unbiased and professional manner. Informative messages can be short or long, formal or casual in tone, internal or external in focus, and direct or indirect in structure, depending on the situation" [^1]

## Communication Purpose

We do things for a reason. As well as being graded on a course, we communicate with people for many reasons. Consider the following questions:

- What is your reason for writing to someone? Maybe your purpose is to maintain friendship.
- What is your reason for applying for this job and not that job? This company gives me a better salary.
- What is your reason for speaking up in a meeting? The group needs clarity on the assignment.
- What is your reason for keeping quiet in the same meeting? My purpose is to keep the peace.

Your communication has many purposes. The key ones we'll focus on are the following:

- to inform
- to educate
- to persuade
- to give constructive feedback
- to request
- to facilitate interaction
- to motivate
- to give bad news

Before you write, make sure you know the purpose. Alongside audience analysis, knowing your purpose gives you excellent data to help your next steps.

You can see that writing clearly takes planning. This planning may take time at first, and it will become more natural as you practice.

!!! Summary

    Once you have the purpose, you have a better idea of the structure, tone, and language to use.
