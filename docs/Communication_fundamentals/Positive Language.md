# Positive Language

taken from [Introduction to Professional Communication](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/professionalcomms/chapter/4-1-style-tone/#:~:text=Style%20gives%20your%20writing%20a,when%20they%20decode%20your%20document).

Unless there is a specific reason not to, use positive language wherever you can. Positive language benefits your writing in two ways. First, it creates a positive tone, and your writing is more likely to be well-received. Second, it clarifies your meaning, as positive statements are more concise. Take a look at the following negatively worded sentences and then their positive counterparts, below.

!!! Tip "Examples"

    **Negative**: Your assignment will not be ready for review until Friday.

    **Positive**: Your assignment will be ready for review on Friday.

    **Negative**: You did not complete the assignment.

    **Positive**: You will need to complete the assignment.

Avoid using multiple negatives in one sentence, as this will make your sentence difficult to understand. When readers encounter more than one negative construct in a sentence, their brains have to do more cognitive work to decipher the meaning; multiple negatives can create convoluted sentences that bog the reader down.

!!! Tip "Examples"

    Negative: A decision will not be made unless all board members agree.
    Positive: A decision will be made when all board members agree.

    Negative: The event cannot be scheduled without a venue.
    Positive: The event can be scheduled when a venue has been booked.
