# Credibility

Credibility -  also known as being trusted, believed, or convincing - is essential for your communication to succeed.

If you are credible, people trust you, believe what you say, and have confidence in you.

If you are not credible, people may have any confidence or trust in your words, and your message may get lost or forgotten.

Credibility has two parts:

    - is your information credible?
    - are you credible?

## Where credibility matters

Credibility matters in all communication, but it is essential in some places more than others.

Your *resume*, as ever, is such an important document. For the reader - who may only spend 30-60 seconds scanning your work - the information must be believable on first reading.

When you say you are an *expert* in JavaScript after a two-year diploma in a computing program, you *will not be believed* as it takes much longer to gain this level of skill. Therefore, your resume may get discarded because you lack credibility.

Any time you provide evidence, when you make an assertion, you have to back this information up with evidence. When you write or say "All programming jobs will be taken by AI", you need to use evidence from a credible source, or you sound like someone who is making things up.

Credibility makes people listen and makes them want to read your words. It also impacts what people think of you. Hopefully, you want people to think positive things about you. If so, make sure your credibility is high.

### How to get credibility when you are starting out

- Show evidence of what you did, how you did it, the results of your work, and what you learned.

- Show you are keen to learn, to develop, and to help.

- Show you have done your research.

- Do what you say you will do. Do it by the time you said. Keep group mates up to date.

- Be timely in your responses.

#### Credibility in presentations

When public speaking, credibility is key to making the audience want to listen, as well as believing you. We'd believe a software developer with 10 years of C## experience more than a friend who has just read an article on C## if we want to learn some technical concepts.

When you are starting out, credibility can be difficult to achieve, but it is important to still try to gain credibility in your audience's eyes.

When you present on a topic:

- do the background research and let the audience know you have spent time learning: "I've spent x hours researching this on trusted websites."
- choose a topic you know: "I have spent 15 years playing Minecraft, modding it, and creating YouTube videos, so I can safely say I have great experience."
- share your passion: "I've always loved soccer, played it, watched it, read about it, and even written a 150-page paper on it for my Masters"

The above are a few examples of establishing credibility. The audience is likely to believe and trust you, and they may therefore listen more attentively.
