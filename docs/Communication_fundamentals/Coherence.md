# Coherence

!!! Tip "Coherence"

    **The way your sentences connect and the way your paragraphs connect make your writing organized. Organized writing is structured and has consistent tone**.

Coherence means organized logically and connecting together.

Your writing is coherent when

- the information in a sentence reads easily and flows (correct grammar and punctuation help)
- sentences connect to one another logically, so readers understand your thoughts (use transition, repetition, unification)
- paragraphs connect logically, so the reader can see the progression of ideas from one paragraph to the next (transitions)

## Ways to be coherent: use transitions

Transitions = logic; logic = coherence; coherence = clarity.

The first column in the table below shows sentences with no transitions, and these sentences lack coherence.

The second column shows an added transition in italics, and the final column shows the logic the writer attempted with these transitions.

| No transition  | Added transition | Logic |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| The final exam was difficult. I still passed. | The final exam was difficult; *nevertheless*, I still passed.  | **Contrast** |
| I aced the final. I got into Co-op. | I aced the final. What's more, I got into Co-op.  | **Addition** |
| I presented for ten minutes and thought it went well. | As a result, I feel more comfortable in front of an audience.  | **Cause and Effect** |
| I want to complete Term 1 with a high GPA. I want to apply for Co-op if I think it will benefit me. | First off, I want to complete Term 1 with a high GPA. After that, I want to apply for Co-op if I think it will benefit me.  | **Sequence** |

## Ways to be coherent: use signposts

Like transitions, signposts help the reader to know your direction.Signposts are like major transitions.

If your direction is to summarize and conclude, you can use "To conclude from the data above, we can see..." or "In conclusion", for example. 

If your direction is to introduce a new idea, you can use "One aspect which shows.." or "The following section provides an overview of the main topics for discussion", for example.

## Ways to be coherent: use the "Given-New Principle"

From sentence 2 in the example below, the words in italics are related to the end of the previous sentence. This "given" information helps connect ideas and helps reading to flow more easily. The new information is provided after the given information to help coherence.

!!! Example
    
    We have been looking at ways to make the downtown campus more student friendly. *This student-centred approach* allows us to meet students where they are at in their learning now. *Focusing on students current state* allows us to provide impact through changes in classrooms, additional spaces, and their general environment."

## Ways to be coherent: write paragraphs containing a single topic

A paragraph is a sentence or a series of sentences focused on *one topic only*. As soon as the topic shifts, a new paragraph begins.

## Ways to be coherent: use parallel structure

Parallel structure means using the same word type or phrase type to make ideas flow. When reading, flow happens when we keep reading without having to stop. We stop when an unexpected change occurs, for example. Humans are pattern focused, and using patterns adds to flow. Parallel structure is a pattern that helps.

In the table below, two sentences are provided. The first does not use parallel structure, and the second does. The final column shows which word, phrase, or clause types are made parallel. 

| Not parallel  | Parallel | Type |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| I love my new students. *They are friendly, supportive, and they always come to class on time*. | I love my new students. They are *friendly, supportive, and punctual*.  | **adjective** |
|The institute focuses on *teamwork, collaborating, interdependence, and being responsible*. | The institute focuses on *teamwork, cooperation, interdependence, and responsibility**.  | **noun** |
|The institute focuses on *teamwork, collaborating, interdependence, and being responsible*. | The institute focuses on *working in teams, cooperating, being interdependent, and being responsible**.  | **verb** |
|They wrote the exam *quickly, accurately, and in detail*. | They wrote the exam *quickly, accurately, and thoroughly*.  | **adverb** |
|Whether *at home or while I am working*, I am constantly thinking |Whether at home or at work, I am constantly thinking.| **phrase**|
|I remember my summer vacation, *when I swam so much and was always reading,* |I remember my summer vacation, when I swam so much and when I read continually.| **clause**|

## Ways to be coherent: think and plan

Planning, which requires thinking, is essential to superb communication. Take time to plan, to think about what you want to say, and to become a clearer communicator.

- Consider your audience, your purpose, and your main idea.
- Focus each paragraph on a single topic.
    - Remember a sentence is a paragraph in workplace communication.
- Use transitions and signposts.
    - Transitions create logic for the reader. However = contrast, for example
    - Think about the logic you want to create between ideas.
    - Signposts indicate to reader your next move. "In conclusion. To sum up."
