# Text Basics

- left justify all text
- avoid indenting text. only academic writing uses indents.
- use size 11 or 12 font (Google Docs/ Word)
- keep margins as they are when opening Word/GDocs
- add a space between paragraphs. clear space aids readability
- page numbers can appear in the header or footer
