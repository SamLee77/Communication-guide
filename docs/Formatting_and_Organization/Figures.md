# Figures and other images

Figures and images provide the reader with useful visual explanations and support. As a writer, you can use an image when it is easier to show something, rather than write something.

Figures are commonly used in short and long reports, user guides, and presentations.

- [x] **Recommended:** Follow this three-part structure:

- introduce the figure *before* you show it.
- show the figure (and add a caption).
- explain the figure *after* you show it.
