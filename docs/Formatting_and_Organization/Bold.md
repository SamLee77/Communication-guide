# Bold

!!! Tip "Bold"

    Use bold for emphasis of specific elements in your writing.

Use bold for the following three main purposes:

- Specific list types.

- Notices.

- Elements of user guides.

**Note:** the function of bold is evolving. Follow this current version of the style guide and understand that all guides evolve.

## Lists and bold

Bold is used for a specific list type, called a *Labeled list*. See the example below.

!!! Example "Bold in labeled lists"

    Three types of list can be used: 
    
    - **Bulleted list**: Items in a bullet list are *not* in sequence/order. 

    - **Numbered list**: Items in the list are *in specific order* (first, next, then). These kinds of lists are used for instructions where steps need to be followed to complete the actions.

    - **Labeled list:** each list item needs further explanation, so a label is added to the list item.

Keep use of bold to the three functions above: notices, user guides, and labeled lists.

## Notices and bold

A notice includes words like **Note, Caution, Warning, Danger.**

The notice itself is bolded; the words that follow are not.

!!! Example "Example bold in notices"

    **Caution:** Pressing the X button will end the program.

## User guides and bold

Bold is commonly used to describe User Interface (UI) elements.

!!! Example "Bold in user guides"

    1. Click **File, Save a Copy** to save your work with a new name.

    2. Enter the new filename in the **Name** field.

When writing user guides, tell the user how bold is being used. This guide sub-section might be called *Typographical Conventions*.
