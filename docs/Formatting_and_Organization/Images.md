# Images

Images can include pictures, figures, and tables.

Images must have a reason for being included. they need value for the reader. Don't add an image if it doesn't add value.

- Images require captions (table captions above table, picture/figure captions below table)
- all images must be mentioned in the text *before* they are shown (Figure 1 shows an example of an API request to a server)
- all images must be explained *after* you show them (the API process is .......)

Give an example here to show 3 stages of complete image use in writing.

If image is from source, add source.
