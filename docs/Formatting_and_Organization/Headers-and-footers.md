# Headers and footers

Headers and footers mean something different for writing and software/web development.

In *writing*, headers and footers are used in Word and Google Docs documents to add additional document information for the reader.

Generally, headers can contain the document title, if requested, especially in reports. They can also include your name, as well as pages numbers.

Here is an example of a typical report header in Google Docs.

![header with information added]

The header contains the document name - which is the report name also - as well as the author name.

To add information to a header, and to organize headers for reports, **see this link. Sam create link**

!!! Note

    Headers are not the same as headings in writing. Headers are page elements that can include titles, authors, and page numbers. [Headings](./Headings.md) let a reader know what section or part of a section they are reading.
