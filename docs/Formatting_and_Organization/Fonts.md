# Fonts

This section will focus on font types and sizes.

## Font types

Two font types are seen in writing: serif and sans-serif.

### Serif fonts


### Sans serif fonts

The font used in this guide is an example of a sans serif font. *Sans* means without, and this font group does not contain any of the small serifs (or marks).

### Which font to use?

As a writer, choose the font based on its reading situation. If the reader is using a printed document, use serif fonts. If the reader is reading on a screen, use sans-serif fonts.

## Font size

Make sure the font size is easy to read.

- [x] Always use size 11 or 12 font.
