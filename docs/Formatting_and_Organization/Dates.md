# Dates

Dates are not written in a standard way globally, so readers need clarity for this feature. 

When we see a date such as 09-08-23, we cannot be 100% sure whether the 09 is a *day* or a *month*.

In general, spell out the names of the months and days in full, and spell out the full four-digit year.
