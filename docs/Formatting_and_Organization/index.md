# Formatting and organization

!!! Tip "Format and organize effectively"

    Style guides create consistency for writers and their audience.

Style guides require you to follow expectations for formatting documents, slides, and any communication you produce. 

That way, you can be consistent with everyone in your team, project, and organization.

This consistency allows you to make life easy for the reader, listener, and watcher. The "sameness" means the flow of communication is easy, and the reader doesn't stop when they encounter something different.
