# Direct structure

The *direct structure* is common in workplace writing as it allows messages to be clear, concise, complete, and reader focused.

Use direct structure for emails, memos, and letters that give information and request information, most commonly. Many report types also use a similar structure.

## Value for readers and writers

The major value of the direct structure is that the purpose and main idea of  message is presented immediately, and so it is clear for the reader from the beginning of the message. The reader can then decide how important the message is and also decide to continue reading or not. 

Direct structure messages put information into clear sections, so the reader has information set out logically. This information supports the main idea.

The structure also allows space for clear action steps from the writer or the reader, a space for goodwill, and a space for communication to continue, of necessary.

As a *writer*, the structure helps you to place information logically too. For example, if you want to add actions for the reader, they are placed in a specific section.

As sections are organized, the reader can see everything they need to do in one place. This placement helps readability, reader focus, message clarity, and paragraphs focused on specific topics.

## Organization of direct structure messages

At its basic, the direct structure is

- **Opening**: The opening introduces the main idea and purpose of the message.
- **Body**: The *body* adds detailed information based on the main idea
- **Closing**: The *closing* provides next steps.

More details of this structure appear in the next section.

### Main idea

The main idea is a separate paragraph which always comes after the greeting, on a new line.

Here are the key components:

- Deliver the main message and communication purpose immediately.
- Answer reader's question: "What is this message about?"
- Remove fillers, such as "I am writing", as they remove directness
- Keep details to a minimum; they appear in the details section

!!! Example

    Please come to class Wednesday with your presentation plans complete, so that we can review as a group and provide feedback for the main presentation.

If you are unsure of the main idea, write the rest of the message first. Then, look at the topic of each paragraph and summarize it briefly.

### Background/Context

Often you give the reader some background information before you get into details. This background should be separate from main idea and details paragraphs.

!!! Example 

    As you may know, the presentations are on October 23rd. To be able to deliver a strong presentation, a fully formed plan will enable me and others to give you feedback. You can then use this feedback to alter the plan as appropriate.

Here are the key components:

- Why are you telling them this information?
- What does it have to do with them?

### Details

Here you explain the who, what, when, where, how to give the reader all the information necessary.

Inside the details section, each paragraph should be on a separate topic (one line is ok for a paragraph if the topic shifts).

!!! Example 

    A complete presentation plan means that every question has been answered, either using complete sentences or bullets. 
    
    Complete also means you have organized each slide, its animations, and images with references in IEEE form. 

    In the session, teams of four will view each other's plans and provide feedback on elements from the specifications sheet. 

    I'll also chat to each of you for 5 minutes to provide answers to any questions.

### Next Step/s

Here you want to let the reader know what to do with this information and any next steps for writer and/or reader.

!!! Example

    Please let me know beforehand if you will not be attending class, if your plan won't be complete (with reasons), and if you are struggling with any element of the plan. 

    You can book an office hour before the session to get answers to questions in person. 

    Also, please upload your plan to the Learning Management System (LMS) before the class has started. 

You can see that next steps can be more than one paragraph. If the topic shifts, start a new paragraph, no matter how small.
