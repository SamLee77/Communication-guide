# Working in groups

This section will highlight group activities that you can use to evaluate how ell they support any project you work on.

The activities will include:

- working agreements
- [team meetings]()
- work organisation

The focus of all these activities is for you to try them, and to personally recognize their value for group work.

As you speak to future employers, you may be asked about team projects, about organizing them, getting work done, dealing with issues, and your specific roles you undertook in any project.

You will also be expected to show what you learned from these activities, and how what you learned brings value to any future employer.

So, dive in, read about the activities, and be prepared to test them out.
